# Airbnb scraper

## Description

This project is an airbnb scraper.

## How to use it

- Run `python3 scraper.py` from the main folder

## Structure

The scraper uses two module: airbnb.py, that contains functions specific to Airbnb HTML codebase, and scraping.py, that contains generic functions used for scraping.

## If I had more time...

I would have start thinking about the database aspect (relational/non-relational, and db schema).
